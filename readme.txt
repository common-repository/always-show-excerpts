Always show Excerpts instead of the full post content for selected types of archive pages.

== Description ==

After getting annoyed that the default 2017 theme was showing the full post content on every index page, I extended <a href="https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/a/77947/25187">this support answer</a> into this plugin that can filter calls to "the_content" and return the post excerpt instead.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the **/wp-content/plugins/always-show-excerpts/** directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Go to the Settings -> Reading page to configure the plugin, picking which types of archives should be affected.
